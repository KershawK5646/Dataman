KNOWN ISSUES and FIXES:

	1. As of initial release, only integers (including negative integers)
	can be used throughout the entirety of the Dataman project. Whenever 
	user is asked for a number, inputting anything other than an integer 
	will result in being told to try again. This will not crash the program.

	2. In Memory Bank:
		
		a. As of initial release, .csv files cannot be imported due to
		formatting issues. Please use the Create Deck option to create a deck
		of cards to be studied later.
		
		b. If user creates a deck of zero cards, 
		and then attempts to study, the program will crash.
		User will then need to restart the Dataman program by
		rerunning mainMenu.py if they want to continue.

			***FIXED*** User can now "create" a deck of zero cards.

		c. User cannot remove cards from deck. If user wants to study 
		created cards and then study different cards, user will have to 
		exit Dataman entirely and then reenter Memory Bank. Otherwise, using
		the Create option again will only append new cards to the existing
		deck. WARNING: Deck is emptied at the start of Memory Bank!

			***FIXED*** User can now delete deck by using Empty Deck option
				at the main menu.

		d. User cannot create multiples of the same card. If "1+1=2"
		already exists, it cannot be added again. If user would like to study
		existing cards multiple times, answer yes when prompted "Would you
		like to study the same cards again?"
